# Consul ACL Bootstrap

Command: `consul acl bootstrap`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint:
[`[GET] /v1/acl/bootstrap`](/api-docs/acl#bootstrap-acls)

**^^ Cross ref option 1: inline with command**

The `acl bootstrap` command will request Consul to generate a new token with unlimited privileges to use
for management purposes and output its details. This can only be done once and afterwards bootstrapping
will be disabled. If all tokens are lost and you need to bootstrap again you can follow the bootstrap
[reset procedure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/acl-troubleshooting?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs#reset-the-acl-system).

**vv Cross ref option 2: aside at bottom of command overview**

The corresponding HTTP endpoint is [`[GET] /v1/acl/bootstrap`](/api-docs/acl#bootstrap-acls).

**vv ACLs option 1: bare minimum**

The table below shows this command's support for
[required ACLs](/commands#consul_http_token).

| ACL Required |
| ------------ |
| `none`       |

**vv ACLs option 2: mention API config possibilities**

The table below shows this command's support for [required ACLs](/commands#consul_http_token).
Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency), and
[agent caching](/api/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the
corresponding HTTP endpoint.

| ACL Required |
| ------------ |
| `none`       |

**vv ACLs option 3: full command details**

The table below shows this command's support for
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency) and
[required ACLs](/commands#consul_http_token).
Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking),
the `consistent` [consistency mode](/api/features/consistency), and
[agent caching](/api/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the
corresponding HTTP endpoint.

| Consistency Modes | ACL Required |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `none`            | `none`       |

(**internal note**: this HTTP API endpoint doesn't really support consistency modes. It
technically accepts the `-stale` argument according to the docs, but it has
no effect on non-read operations.)

**vv ACLs option 4: full command details and extra API config options**

The table below shows this command's support for
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency), and
[required ACLs](/commands#consul_http_token).

\*Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking) and
[agent caching](/api/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, so the table below instead shows support from
the corresponding HTTP API endpoint. If such configuration is needed, use that
HTTP API endpoint instead of this command.

| \*Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes  | \*Agent Caching | ACL Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`               | `default`, `stale` | `none`          | `none`       |

(**internal note**: this HTTP API endpoint doesn't really support consistency modes. It
technically accepts the `-stale` argument according to the docs, but it has
no effect on non-read operations.)
